## Introduction

Sometimes, it is desirable to assign the result of a computation to a variable, or an alternate value if the computation fails.
If the computation in question outputs a falsy value, the Ternary Operator `?:` or its short syntax can be used.
If the computation returns `null`, the Null Coalesce Operator `?:` can also be used, or even preferred in cases where falsy values should be considered valid.
But when the computation throws an exception, only the verbose `try` block is available.

This RFC introduces the Exception Coalesce Operator `???`, which evaluates and returns its left-hand side unless an exception is thrown in the course of the evaluation, and returns its right-hand side in that case.

## Proposal

Introduce the `???` operator, such that the following two blocks of code are equivalent:

```php
try {
    $result = computation();
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    $result = 'alternate';
}


$result = computation() ??? 'alternate';
```

Extended and formal description TODO.

Alternative forms of the operator TODO.

### Example: Combined with itself

The operator can be used several times within a single statement, evaluating each subsequent left-hand side as needed.
This example shows the increasing returns this proposal enables, eliminating large, deeply-nested, hard-to-read structures and enabling more fluent patterns.
Consider these as equivalent:

```php
$result = optionA() ??? optionB() ??? $fallback;

try {
    $result = optionA();
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    try {
        $result = optionB();
    } catch (Throwable $e) {
        $result = $fallback }
    }
}
```

### Example: Combined with other similar operators

The operator can be combined with the Null Coalesce and the Short Ternary in the usual way:

```php
$result = compute() ??? $alternate->property ?? $known ?: 'fallback';
```

If the succesful result of the left-hand side should be further checked, parentheses can be used to obtain the desired effect.
Consider these as equivalent:

```php
$result = (compute() ?? $fallback) ??? 'otherwise';

try {
    $result = compute() ?? $fallback;
} catch (Throwable $e) {
    $result = 'otherwise';
}
```

## Backward Incompatible Changes

None.

## Proposed PHP Version

Next major.

## RFC Impact

### To SAPIs
None.

### To Existing Extensions
None.

### To Opcache
TODO.

### New Constants
None.

### php.ini Defaults
None.

## Unaffected PHP Functionality

No existing functionality is affected by this, other than the new capabilities outlined in the proposal.

## Future Scope

This proposal only covers user-catchable exceptions.
This is intentional in order to keep the scope reasonable and the semantics consistent.
However, a future RFC could explore further catching errors.

Additionally, a future proposal could explore an Assignment version of this operator: `$result ???= compute()`.

Furthermore, a unary `???` variant could be envisaged, akin but not equivalent to the Error Supressing Operator `@`.

## Proposed Voting Choices

As this is a language change, a 2/3 majority is required.

## Patches and Tests

TODO.

## References

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) doesn't have exceptions, but its `Result` type has the [`unwrap_or`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap_or) family of methods, which behave similarly to this operator:

```rust
let result = compute().unwrap_or("fallback");
let another = compute().unwrap_or_else(|| fallback());
```

Ruby is an expression-oriented language, which makes the kind of patterns this operator enables also fairly common:

```ruby
result = begin
    compute
end || 'fallback'
```

It also supports the Assignment variant mentioned in **Future Work**:

```ruby
result ||= begin
    compute
end
```
